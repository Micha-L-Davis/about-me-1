        Hi, I'm Jeffrey Jenkins, a software developer currently learning the ropes in Code Fellows 201: <i>Foundations of Software Development</i>. I have a background in electrical engineering and medical device manufacturing. I have an Associates of Applied Science (AAS) degree in Electronics Technology from Lake Washington Institute of Technology, and I attended Redmond High School. 
        <hr>
        My most recent work experience is at Stryker, a medical device conglomerate. The Stryker site I joined in Redmond, WA builds defibrillators and AEDs. My roles there were, first, Troubleshooting Technician and then Ops Test Engineering Technician.
        <hr>
        My goals are to learn a new skillset so that I can continue to grow as an individual. I see incredible potential for myself in the software development industry. I'd love to try developing my own video game someday, or work with neural networks and AI to solve complicated problems in data analysis.
