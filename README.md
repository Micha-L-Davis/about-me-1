### Reflections and Comments

- Creating the first version of this taught me the usefulness of functions. I wanted to use functions to compose the guessing game prompts and answers, but given the requirements I considered that an "out of scope" goal. As a stop-gap, I used a code block that was easy to copy and easy to fill in with the appropriate information.
